## JS Files (for Nick <3)

[.jslib file](https://github.com/gtspencer/webgl-tests/blob/main/Assets/Plugins/test.jslib) that I can call (and return) from C# in Unity.

Currently tries to grab the image from a canvas us toDataURL() but I tainted the canvas with my dirty grossness (adding the cross-origin image)

this [javascript hook](https://github.com/gtspencer/webgl-tests/blob/main/Assets/JavascriptHook.cs) is the c# script I use to call JS

the url for the image file is in the jslib but here it is in plaintext
